Why policies should adapt to evolving patters of cohabitation</strong></a> (with O. Thévenon)</h4>
<p>Chapter in the OUP Handbook Families Across Time - A Life Course Perspective (Published: 23 February 2023).</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract:</strong></em> Growing family complexity and diversity has increased uncertainty about family relationships and weakens the private safety net provided by families for their members. In order to respond to such uncertainty, it is necessary that the legal obligations of family members and the rules providing access to public benefits and safety nets are adapted to the diversity of family living arrangements. This chapter highlights challenges raised by the increasing informality and complexity of family living arrangements in ensuring that all children have equal access to the same level of social support. It discusses policy developments that can be adopted to ensure that parents of children in nontraditional family settings get access to social protections that fully suit their family living arrangements.

Estimating the political persuasion of local television news bias using the Sinclair Broadcast Group as a natural experiment</strong></a></h4>
<p>Working paper, last version: November 2022.</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract:</strong></em> This paper investigates the heterogeneous effect of biased local TV news on political outcomes and opinions in the United States, exploiting the timing of the introduction of biased programming of a conservative-leaning broadcasting company, Sinclair Broadcast Group, over the years 1992-2020. First, I document Sinclair&rsquo;s pattern of bias to argue its local news programming exhibits a conservative slant since the 2004 election, though they operate stations since 1971. Using an event study methodology estimated through a two way fixed effect model, I argue that the within county evolution of electoral outcomes would have been the same, absent the change in Sinclair&rsquo;s content. I find that the county-level response to Sinclair bias on electoral outcomes is heterogeneous across time. Exposure to the change in biased content since 2004 corresponds to a 2.5% point increase in the Republican presidential two party vote share during the 2012 election, an effect that doubles during the 2016/2020 election, in addition to Republican gains in Congress in that same period. The associated persuasion rates are 4.7% of its potential audience in 2008-2012, and 14.4% in 2016-2020. Interactions with county characteristics reveal that the effect is concentrated among “isolated” counties, in contrast to economic factors. Individual level survey data reveals a congruent 8% and 10% point increase in the probability to vote for the Republican (presidential and congressional) candidate in 2016. Individual mechanisms suggest educational heterogeneity in the a rise in (self-declared) xenophobic attitudes and tolerance for racial inequality, yet no increases in support for traditionally Republican policy positions or populist rhetoric. A series of robustness checks rule out competing explanations. The totality of our results suggest that political persuasion is a dynamic process that is sensitive to environmental and personal characteristics.

Jarotschkin and E. Zhuravskaya)</h4>
<p>Resubmitted at the Journal of the European Economic Association (2nd round), last version: March 2023.</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract:</strong></em> We study horizontal between-group cultural transmission using Stalin’s ethnic deportations as a historical experiment. Over 2 million Soviet citizens, mostly Germans and Chechens, were forcibly relocated from the western to eastern parts of the USSR during WWII solely based on ethnicity. As a result, the native population of the deportation destinations
was exogenously exposed to groups with drastically different gender norms and behavior. We combine historical and contemporary data to document that present-day gender equality in labor force participation, business leadership, and fertility as well as
pro-gender-equality attitudes are higher among local native population of deportation destinations with a larger presence of Protestant compared to Muslim deportees. The effects are stronger for culturally closer groups and when adopting deportee norms is less costly. The results cannot be explained by selection, vertical cultural transmission, or deportee impact on the local economy. The evidence strongly suggests that gender norms diffused horizontally from deportees to the local population through imitation and learning.<br>

<p>OECD Work in progress, last version: September 2022.</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract:</strong></em> This paper provides evidence on the effects of digitalisation on the labour market in Slovenia using a unique dataset of Slovenian workers and firms for the years 2016 to 2020. Results show that digitalisation– measured in terms of firm-level ICT investment, is associated with positive and statistically significant effects on firm’s employment. However, job growth is not evenly distributed: High-skilled workers and younger workers benefit the most from employment gains, whereas there is little to no employment increases for low- and medium-skilled workers and older workers aged 50 or more. Furthermore, employment effects from digitalisation are strongest for private manufacturing firms. In contrast, ICT investment by state-owned firms is not associated with employment gains.<br>

Clarke)</h4>
<p>OECD Policy Report, June 2019.</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract:</strong></em> Recruiting and retaining skilled staff is a long-standing challenge for the early childhood education and care (ECEC) sector. OECD countries are increasingly demanding that ECEC staff be highly skilled and highly qualified, but a combination of low wages, a lack of status and public recognition, poor working conditions, and limited opportunities for professional development mean that recruitment and retention are frequently difficult. What can countries do to build a highly qualified and well-trained ECEC workforce? What is the best route to increasing staff skills without exacerbating staff shortages? How can countries boost pay and working conditions in the context of limited resources? Building on past OECD work on early childhood education and care, and drawing on the experience of OECD countries, this report outlines good practice policy measures for improving jobs in ECEC and for constructing a high-quality workforce.</p>
