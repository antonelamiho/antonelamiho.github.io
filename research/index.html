<p><em><strong>Abstract:</strong></em> We study horizontal between-group cultural transmission using Stalin’s ethnic deportations as a historical experiment. Over 2 million Soviet citizens, mostly Germans and Chechens, were forcibly relocated from the western to eastern parts of the USSR during WWII solely based on ethnicity. As a result, the native population of the deportation destinations
was exogenously exposed to groups with drastically different gender norms and behavior. We combine historical and contemporary data to document that present-day gender equality in labor force participation, business leadership, and fertility as well as
pro-gender-equality attitudes are higher among local native population of deportation destinations with a larger presence of Protestant compared to Muslim deportees. The effects are stronger for culturally closer groups and when adopting deportee norms is less costly. The results cannot be explained by selection, vertical cultural transmission, or deportee impact on the local economy. The evidence strongly suggests that gender norms diffused horizontally from deportees to the local population through imitation and learning.<br>

<p>Chapter in the OUP Handbook Families Across Time - A Life Course Perspective (Published: 23 February 2023).</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract:</strong></em> Growing family complexity and diversity has increased uncertainty about family relationships and weakens the private safety net provided by families for their members. In order to respond to such uncertainty, it is necessary that the legal obligations of family members and the rules providing access to public benefits and safety nets are adapted to the diversity of family living arrangements. This chapter highlights challenges raised by the increasing informality and complexity of family living arrangements in ensuring that all children have equal access to the same level of social support. It discusses policy developments that can be adopted to ensure that parents of children in nontraditional family settings get access to social protections that fully suit their family living arrangements.

Political persuasion of local TV news: evidence from Sinclair</strong></a></h4>

<p><em><strong>Abstract:</strong></em> How does partisan local TV news impact political outcomes and opinions? I exploit a sudden change in content by a major broadcasting company in the United States, Sinclair Broadcast Group, to include a conservative slant in the run-up to the 2004 election. Consequently, in counties which experienced this change in slant, I document a 4 to 5% point increase in the Republican presidential two-party vote share during the 2016 and 2020 election, following smaller gains of about 2% in the 2012 election. During this same period, there were also Republican gains in Congress, while there are no pre-trends before the change in content. The effect is concentrated among “isolated” counties—proxied by population decline and the share of native-born and the non- college-educated—in contrast to economic factors. Using a nationally representative survey of voters, I corroborate the county-level findings: the probability of voting for the Republican (presidential and congressional) candidate in 2016 also increased. Additionally, I note a rise in (self-declared) xenophobic attitudes and tolerance for racial inequality among non-college-educated respondents, yet no increases in support for traditionally Republican policy positions or populist rhetoric. A series of robustness checks rule out competing explanations.

Chateau and M. Borowiecki)</h4>
<p>OECD Economics Department Working Paper, last version: November 2023.</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract:</strong></em> This study analyses the economic effects of the EU&rsquo;s ‘Fit for 55’ climate mitigation policies using the OECD ENV-Linkage model, a dynamic, global Computable General Equilibrium model. The model projects macroeconomic, sectoral, energy and emission trends for the EU, and for the five largest EU economies separately, up to 2035. Policy scenarios combine carbon pricing with regulations to reach the ‘Fit For 55’ emission reduction target in 2030. Additional scenarios analyse i) harmonised carbon pricing across countries and sectors, ii) different forms of revenue recycling from carbon pricing, iii) the effect of the EU’s proposed Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism on competitiveness, and iv) the effect of Russia’s war against Ukraine on mitigation costs. Given the short time horizon of the analysis (until 2035), the model does not assess the positive economic benefits associated with fewer climate impacts and extreme climate events. ‘Fit for 55’ policies are projected to lead to a loss of GDP per capita of 2.1% in 2035 compared to the reference scenario (pre-‘Fit for 55’ policies), reflecting increasing production costs on the back of higher carbon pricing. Higher carbon pricing is also projected to lead to a loss of competitiveness in energy-intensive industries. The EU’s proposed Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism may only partly mitigate the loss of competitiveness of energy-intensive industries. Harmonising carbon pricing across sectors would help limit the loss to GDP per capita, as a uniform carbon price is lower and allows for directing emission reduction efforts to sectors and countries with the lowest abatement costs. Finally, Russia’s war against Ukraine has not substantially increased the GDP costs of mitigation. Without the war, lower fossil fuel import prices would have led to higher fossil fuel demand, ultimately requiring more stringent mitigation action.

<p><em><strong>Abstract:</strong></em> This paper provides evidence on the effects of digitalization on the labor market in Slovenia using a unique dataset of Slovenian workers and firms for the years 2016 to 2020. Results show that at the firm level, digitalization, measured in terms of ICT investment, is associated with positive and statistically significant effects on em- ployment. However, job growth is not evenly distributed: High-skilled workers and younger workers benefit the most from employment gains, whereas there is little to no employment increases for low- and medium-skilled workers and older workers aged 50 or over. Furthermore, employment effects from digitalization are strongest for private manufacturing firms.

Clarke)</h4>
<p>OECD Policy Report, June 2019.</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract:</strong></em> Recruiting and retaining skilled staff is a long-standing challenge for the early childhood education and care (ECEC) sector. OECD countries are increasingly demanding that ECEC staff be highly skilled and highly qualified, but a combination of low wages, a lack of status and public recognition, poor working conditions, and limited opportunities for professional development mean that recruitment and retention are frequently difficult. What can countries do to build a highly qualified and well-trained ECEC workforce? What is the best route to increasing staff skills without exacerbating staff shortages? How can countries boost pay and working conditions in the context of limited resources? Building on past OECD work on early childhood education and care, and drawing on the experience of OECD countries, this report outlines good practice policy measures for improving jobs in ECEC and for constructing a high-quality workforce.</p>
