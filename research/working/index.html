Estimating the political persuasion of local television news bias using the Sinclair Broadcast Group as a natural experiment</strong></h4>
<p>Working paper, last version: November 2022.</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract:</strong></em> This paper investigates the heterogeneous effect of biased local TV news on political outcomes and opinions in the United States, exploiting the timing of the introduction of biased programming of a conservative-leaning broadcasting company, Sinclair Broadcast Group, over the years 1992-2020. First, I document Sinclair&rsquo;s pattern of bias to argue its local news programming exhibits a conservative slant since the 2004 election, though they operate stations since 1971. Using an event study methodology estimated through a two way fixed effect model, I argue that the within county evolution of electoral outcomes would have been the same, absent the change in Sinclair&rsquo;s content. I find that the county-level response to Sinclair bias on electoral outcomes is heterogeneous across time. Exposure to the change in biased content since 2004 corresponds to a 2.5% point increase in the Republican presidential two party vote share during the 2012 election, an effect that doubles during the 2016/2020 election, in addition to Republican gains in Congress in that same period. The associated persuasion rates are 4.7% of its potential audience in 2008-2012, and 14.4% in 2016-2020. Interactions with county characteristics reveal that the effect is concentrated among “isolated” counties, in contrast to economic factors. Individual level survey data reveals a congruent 8% and 10% point increase in the probability to vote for the Republican (presidential and congressional) candidate in 2016. Individual mechanisms suggest educational heterogeneity in the a rise in (self-declared) xenophobic attitudes and tolerance for racial inequality, yet no increases in support for traditionally Republican policy positions or populist rhetoric. A series of robustness checks rule out competing explanations. The totality of our results suggest that political persuasion is a dynamic process that is sensitive to environmental and personal characteristics.<br>

<p>Resubmitted at the Journal of the European Economic Association (1st round), last version: September 2022.</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract:</strong></em> We study horizontal between-group cultural transmission using a unique historical experiment. During WWII, Stalin deported over 2 million people&mdash;mostly Germans and Chechens&mdash;to Siberia and Central Asia solely based on their ethnicity. As a result, the native population of the deportation destinations was exogenously exposed to groups with drastically different gender norms and behavior. We combine historical archival data with contemporary census, survey, and enterprise data to document that: first, there are no systematic differences in female labor force participation and education among deportation locations prior to deportations. Second, gender equality in contemporary labor force participation, leadership in business, and fertility is higher in deportation destinations with a larger presence of Protestant compared to Muslim deportees. Contemporary attitudes toward the role of women among native groups and education follow the same pattern. These effects cannot be fully explained either by vertical cultural transmission as they hold for the native groups in the deportation locations, or by differential economic conditions, which do not vary enough with the group composition of deportees. Instead, the evidence strongly suggests that gender norms diffused horizontally from deportees to the local population, affecting attitudes and behavior.<br>

<p>OECD Work in progress, last version: September 2022.</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract:</strong></em> This paper provides evidence on the effects of digitalisation on the labour market in Slovenia using a unique dataset of Slovenian workers and firms for the years 2016 to 2020. Results show that digitalisation– measured in terms of firm-level ICT investment, is associated with positive and statistically significant effects on firm’s employment. However, job growth is not evenly distributed: High-skilled workers and younger workers benefit the most from employment gains, whereas there is little to no employment increases for low- and medium-skilled workers and older workers aged 50 or more. Furthermore, employment effects from digitalisation are strongest for private manufacturing firms. In contrast, ICT investment by state-owned firms is not associated with employment gains.<br>
