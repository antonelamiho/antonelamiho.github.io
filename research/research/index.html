Estimating the political persuasion of local television news bias using the Sinclair Broadcast Group as a natural experiment</strong></h4>
<p>Working paper, last version: November 2022.</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract:</strong></em> This paper investigates the heterogeneous effect of biased local TV news on political outcomes and opinions in the United States, exploiting the timing of the introduction of biased programming of a conservative-leaning broadcasting company, Sinclair Broadcast Group, over the years 1992-2020. First, I document Sinclair&rsquo;s pattern of bias to argue its local news programming exhibits a conservative slant since the 2004 election, though they operate stations since 1971. Using an event study methodology estimated through a two way fixed effect model, I argue that the within county evolution of electoral outcomes would have been the same, absent the change in Sinclair&rsquo;s content. I find that the county-level response to Sinclair bias on electoral outcomes is heterogeneous across time. Exposure to the change in biased content since 2004 corresponds to a 2.5% point increase in the Republican presidential two party vote share during the 2012 election, an effect that doubles during the 2016/2020 election, in addition to Republican gains in Congress in that same period. The associated persuasion rates are 4.7% of its potential audience in 2008-2012, and 14.4% in 2016-2020. Interactions with county characteristics reveal that the effect is concentrated among “isolated” counties, in contrast to economic factors. Individual level survey data reveals a congruent 8% and 10% point increase in the probability to vote for the Republican (presidential and congressional) candidate in 2016. Individual mechanisms suggest educational heterogeneity in the a rise in (self-declared) xenophobic attitudes and tolerance for racial inequality, yet no increases in support for traditionally Republican policy positions or populist rhetoric. A series of robustness checks rule out competing explanations. The totality of our results suggest that political persuasion is a dynamic process that is sensitive to environmental and personal characteristics.<br>

<p>Resubmitted at the Journal of the European Economic Association (1st round), last version: September 2022.</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract:</strong></em> We study horizontal between-group cultural transmission using a unique historical experiment. During WWII, Stalin deported over 2 million people&mdash;mostly Germans and Chechens&mdash;to Siberia and Central Asia solely based on their ethnicity. As a result, the native population of the deportation destinations was exogenously exposed to groups with drastically different gender norms and behavior. We combine historical archival data with contemporary census, survey, and enterprise data to document that: first, there are no systematic differences in female labor force participation and education among deportation locations prior to deportations. Second, gender equality in contemporary labor force participation, leadership in business, and fertility is higher in deportation destinations with a larger presence of Protestant compared to Muslim deportees. Contemporary attitudes toward the role of women among native groups and education follow the same pattern. These effects cannot be fully explained either by vertical cultural transmission as they hold for the native groups in the deportation locations, or by differential economic conditions, which do not vary enough with the group composition of deportees. Instead, the evidence strongly suggests that gender norms diffused horizontally from deportees to the local population, affecting attitudes and behavior.<br>

<p>OECD Work in progress, last version: September 2022.</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract:</strong></em> This paper provides evidence on the effects of digitalisation on the labour market in Slovenia using a unique dataset of Slovenian workers and firms for the years 2016 to 2020. Results show that digitalisation– measured in terms of firm-level ICT investment, is associated with positive and statistically significant effects on firm’s employment. However, job growth is not evenly distributed: High-skilled workers and younger workers benefit the most from employment gains, whereas there is little to no employment increases for low- and medium-skilled workers and older workers aged 50 or more. Furthermore, employment effects from digitalisation are strongest for private manufacturing firms. In contrast, ICT investment by state-owned firms is not associated with employment gains.<br>

<p>Forthcoming as a chapter in the OUP Handbook Families Across Time - A Life Course Perspective (expected March 2023), last version: March 2020.</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract:</strong></em> Modern family life brings with it profound changes to children&rsquo;s family living arrangements. An increasing number of children live with unmarried parents whose informal cohabitation implies unequal rights in terms of access to welfare benefit and social protection programmes compared to those in married life. In addition, children experiencing family dissolution are increasingly likely to share their time between the two homes of the separated parents, and/or to live in a stepfamily. The family living arrangements that result from these trends are very diverse and generally not well identified by official statistics, as well as their consequences on families’ living standards.
This paper takes stock of the trends in children&rsquo;s family living arrangements based on available international statistics and calls for the development of data that more accurately and reliably reflect children&rsquo;s family situation and its economic consequences. It also discusses adaptations of social protection systems to ensure that all children receive support appropriate to their concrete family living arrangements, and to guarantee that children in a non-traditional family setting are treated on an equal footing vis-à-vis children with married parents.
The paper particularly discusses issues raised by the fact that children whose parents live together informally do not always have the same legal and economic security as children of married couples. It also reviews challenges associated with the fact that parents are increasingly sharing custody of their children after separation.<br>

<h4 id="good-practice-for-good-jobs-in-early-childhood-education-and-care-with-c-clarke"><strong>Good Practice for Good Jobs in Early Childhood Education and Care</strong> (with C. Clarke)</h4>
<p>OECD Policy Report, June 2019.</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract:</strong></em> Recruiting and retaining skilled staff is a long-standing challenge for the early childhood education and care (ECEC) sector. OECD countries are increasingly demanding that ECEC staff be highly skilled and highly qualified, but a combination of low wages, a lack of status and public recognition, poor working conditions, and limited opportunities for professional development mean that recruitment and retention are frequently difficult. What can countries do to build a highly qualified and well-trained ECEC workforce? What is the best route to increasing staff skills without exacerbating staff shortages? How can countries boost pay and working conditions in the context of limited resources? Building on past OECD work on early childhood education and care, and drawing on the experience of OECD countries, this report outlines good practice policy measures for improving jobs in ECEC and for constructing a high-quality workforce.</p>
