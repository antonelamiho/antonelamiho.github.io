      <description>Small screen, big echo? Estimating the political persuasion of local television news bias using the Sinclair Broadcast Group as a natural experiment Working paper, last version: November 2022.
Abstract: This paper investigates the heterogeneous effect of biased local TV news on political outcomes and opinions in the United States, exploiting the timing of the introduction of biased programming of a conservative-leaning broadcasting company, Sinclair Broadcast Group, over the years 1992-2020. First, I document Sinclair&amp;rsquo;s pattern of bias to argue its local news programming exhibits a conservative slant since the 2004 election, though they operate stations since 1971.</description>

Abstract: Modern family life brings with it profound changes to children&amp;rsquo;s family living arrangements. An increasing number of children live with unmarried parents whose informal cohabitation implies unequal rights in terms of access to welfare benefit and social protection programmes compared to those in married life.</description>
